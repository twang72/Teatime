# CS 5610 Project Proposal - Teatime

## Clarify your target audience (Jieyu)
### What are your application users' needs and pain points?
Our application's target users are people who love tea and have a preference for tea drinks with caffeine or milk. 

Users’ Needs:
- Users want the drink stores to have delivery services so that they can order the drinks they like online from the drinks stores directly,  easily, and smoothly. A web application that enables them to place orders, track orders, and have favorites.
- Users want to have a clear layout in this web application so that they can easily browse different kinds of drinks and the details about each drink. The customers, especially those who are on a diet, may need to know specific info such as ingredients and nutrition.
- Users want to save money. Most customers would love to have a promotion when they buy products and also it would be better if there is a reward mechanism provided to loyalty customers.

Pain Points:
The customers will actually have to pay much more to place orders through food delivery apps than they buy drinks at stores in person. Many drinks stores do not provide food delivery service directly, so the users will have to place orders through third party platforms such as UberEats and DoorDash. However, those food delivery apps usually charge 20-30% service fee from the Merchant and 10% service fee from the Customer. Most merchants will raise the product price to cover the 20-30 service fee that is charged by the food delivery Apps, which results in more cost for customers.

### What problem/task(s)/need does the application help the users address?
To solve the needs as mentioned above, we develop an online website for the owner of a drinks store. Our application provides owners with these features:

- The straightforward style of website layout. Customers can get the category and search bar on the home page at first glance. They can browse the website to view each product and click that product to jump to a subpage with its related info, e.g. nutrition. Or they can use the search bar to find the desired product quickly.
- Quickly placing an online order. Once logged in, the customer can choose different kinds of add-ons, sugar levels, ice levels and quantities on each product's page. Then the users can add it to the shopping cart and proceed to payment.
- Membership management. The customer can create an account on the website. Account holders can save their favourite products, rank stars and write reviews on each product. The owner can provide promotions to loyal customers, such as buy 10 get one free.

## Do some competitor research to see what other people have done to solve similar problems and explain how your group application proposes to improve existing solutions - at least one feature should be either completely new OR an improvement on similar feature(s) of similar existing web applications.

An increasing number of people are considering opening their own independent drinks Stores. We aim to help these small business owners develop their own drinks  websites to compete with large franchise drink stores and manage the ordering system without using third-party food delivery platforms such as UberEats and DoorDash.
We found the websites of three major franchise drink sellers in the Greater Vancouver Area and compared their features with ours as below:

Through comparisons, we found that all major competitors do not put product search and category functions in their homepage, only displaying them when users get to their online ordering pages. We understand they have plenty of drinking products and thus they’d like to display all products only on the menu page. However, as most independent sellers will focus on developing their signature drinks, we will integrate product search and category functions with the homepage so that customers can quickly find the products and purchase them online. In addition, we are strong believers that you are what you eat, which means we will add product calories to each drinking product and let users choose what they’d like to enjoy. However, due to the limited time we have for the development, we will only integrate a static store location page and not include product filters (product ranking) with this Beta version.
